# Caesar Cipher Decryption - Computer Networks Assignment

This Python code decrypts an encrypted message consisting of approximately 150 words using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

## How It Works

1. The encrypted message is stored in the `text` variable.
2. The Caesar Cipher key is set in the `key` variable.
3. The `decrypt_caesar` function performs the decryption.
4. The original message is printed to the console.
